##Google Play Games and Amazon GameCircle sample

This repository is a quick sample of how you can support both [Google Play Games](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) and [Amazon GameCircle](https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/apis/engage/gamecircle) APIs in your application by leveraging product flavors.

### Google Play Games:
- You will need to go through the process of setting up [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling) at Google.
- You will need to update the [game-ids.xml](https://github.com/michaelcarrano/AndroidGamesSdkSample/blob/master/app/src/google/res/values/game-ids.xml) with the ids from Google.


### Amazon GameCircle:
- You will need to go through the process of setting up a [GameCircle configuration](https://developer.amazon.com/gc/cfg/index.html) at Amazon.
- Update the [api_key.txt](https://github.com/michaelcarrano/AndroidGamesSdkSample/blob/master/app/src/amazon/assets/api_key.txt) with the real file from Amazon.
- Update the [game-ids.xml](https://github.com/michaelcarrano/AndroidGamesSdkSample/blob/master/app/src/amazon/res/values/game-ids.xml) with the ids from Amazon.
